# Predicting solid state qubit qubit candidates

This repository is built up by several parts.
1. dataExtraction
	Obtain and generate the entire dataset.
2. dataMining
	Use datamining to find labels for either good candidates or not
3. machineLearning
	Utilise machine learning to find other good candidates.

Within each folder there exists new structures. Here, we gather the structure
