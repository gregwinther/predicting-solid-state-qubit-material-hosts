# Algorithms
Below we define the algorithm to use and its abbreviation. Parameters that are optional to tune are the parameters to the algorithms, with the default value as their optimised value. Another parameter to tune is how many cross-validations one wants to iterate through for the analysis. In addition, one has to find the best features for a new algorithm which will be added further down in the notebook.
